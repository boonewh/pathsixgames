				The saga unfolded as our heroes emerged from aiding the stricken inhabitants of the House of Withering Blossoms. Under the dusky canopy of an ancient forest, they were shepherded to its margins by Miyaro, who whispered tales of a secluded camp harboring ronin warriors. Upon their arrival, the camp revealed itself to be a poignant tableau of resilience—peopled mostly by children and elders, its youth handling bows with somber determination, a silent testament to the ravages of war. Our group's arrival, a cavalcade of foreign mystery, drew many an inquisitive gaze from the camp's inhabitants.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within moments of their entrance, the air tinged with the scent of pine and impending rain, they were greeted by Habesuta Hatsu. Her eyes, sharp and discerning, betrayed her curiosity about these unusual guests. Soon after, the camp's leader, Harabashi Jiro, appeared, his demeanor as stern as the mountainous landscape that cradled their refuge. Our adventurers presented their quest to restore Ameiko to the throne of Minkai, met initially with skepticism. Jiro, unmoved by words alone, proposed a challenge: a sealed vault within a mountain fortress, now overrun by bandits, could only be opened by royal blood. Should Ameiko succeed, he would lend his support. The catch? The fortress had been fortified by its current marauding occupants, adding a dangerous twist to their task.
			</p>
			<p>
				The plan of action was swiftly devised. Scouts Aelfread, Edam, and Shalelu ventured forth, melding with the shadows to surveil the bandit-held bastion. Based on their intelligence, Shura, ever the strategist, dispatched his earth elemental to sow chaos within the fortress's heart. As the elemental stirred turmoil, our heroes exploited the distraction: Haldir, with a flick of his wrist and a whispered incantation, unlocked the front gate. Aelfread ascended the left tower to silence the archers, Edam stormed the right, and Tim, with resolute courage, led the frontal assault into the throbbing pulse of the courtyard. Amidst a symphony of clashing steel and arcane explosions, Shura and Haldir wove a dance of magical support and healing. As Aelfread and Edam dispatched their foes from the high vantage, Tim engaged in a fierce confrontation with a druid morphing into an imperial magma dragon and a fierce female monk, her form blurring into that of a weretiger. Despite their foes' retreat, our heroes emerged victorious, their hearts alight with the thrill of battle and the promise of allies gained—if the vault would yield to Ameiko's touch.

			</figure>
			<p>
				Our intrepid adventurers delved deeper into the labyrinthine corridors of the fortress, each step forward met with staunch resistance from a cadre of bandits far more formidable than mere brigands. In a dimly lit hallway, the druid and the tigress-monk executed a cunning ambush. The monk, a spectral figure on the ceiling, descended abruptly before Edam, her feline agility a blur in the torchlight. However, her surprise attack faltered against Edam’s swift reflexes and lethal wakizashi, marking her final battle. Meanwhile, Aelfread's blade danced deadly arcs through the bandit ranks, and Shura's hammer fell with crushing finality. Yet, through the chaos, the elusive druid vanished into the shadows once more.
			</p>
			<p>
				The journey through the fortress led them next into what appeared to be a mess hall, a stark reminder of daily life amidst conflict. As Edam stepped into the room, his attempt at a disarming wave met with cold stares from the bandits, their mealtime abruptly ending in aggression. The room became a maelstrom of fury as bandits charged. In the ensuing tumult, Shura invoked the Blessing of Fervor, enhancing their fervor for battle, while Haldir, with a subtle gesture, cloaked Edam in invisibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				Amidst the melee, a grim scene unfolded as some bandits seized the serving women, using them as human shields. However, Haldir’s deft magic transported Aelfread instantly across the room, cloaking him in invisibility as well. The battle raged fiercely, and soon, Edam too reappeared across the fray, both warriors cutting a swath through their foes, determined to ensure no threat would loom over the innocents again. Their resolve unyielding, our heroes left behind a clear message: tyranny and cowardice would find no refuge in their presence.

			<p>
				Once assured of the women's safety, our heroes turned their attention to the mysterious druid’s whereabouts. Their search led them to a storeroom filled with vials and organic materials—possibly components for druidic spells or alchemy. The room also featured a crystal-clear pool used for scrying. A mishandled vial disturbed the dust-covered shelf, inadvertently activating spores from the moss overhead. The resulting cloud left everyone coughing and weakened, their vitality sapped temporarily. Recovering, the party discovered a hidden chamber with cages, one concealing a girl shrouded in furs and barely conscious. A spell from Haldir revived her, and though initially frightened, she was reassured of her safety. Edam expertly picked the cage lock, and after learning she knew nothing of the druid's whereabouts, he guided her back to join the other rescued women.
			</p>
			<p>
				Continuing their relentless pursuit, the adventurers stumbled upon an illusionary wall concealing the fortress’s secret entrance—a discovery that tantalized but offered no sign of the druid. Ascending a staircase, Edam scouted ahead and inadvertently entered a storeroom, right into the heart of an ambush. Undeterred and with a touch of flair characteristic of a grey paladin, he revealed himself and the ambush to his companions. What ensued was a fierce battle, demanding every ounce of resilience from our group. Shura and Haldir coordinated their healing efforts, especially to sustain Tim against the formidable bandit leader. With Aelfread covertly maneuvering and striking, the party ultimately emerged victorious, quelling the last of the resistance within the walls of Seinaru Heikiko.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the fortress now cleared and quiet, the moment of truth arrived. Ameiko, standing before the ancient vault, effortlessly unlocked it, her royal lineage undeniable as the door swung open to reveal a trove of weapons and the specific heirloom Jiro had mentioned. Overwhelmed with gratitude and newfound respect, Jiro formally recognized Ameiko's claim and pledged his support. Deeming the fortress an ideal stronghold, our adventurers welcomed the samurai and their caravan within its secure embrace, turning a once formidable bastion of foes into a beacon of hope and resistance.

				In the tumultuous realm of Minkai, a storm brews as the Jade Regent gathers his formidable army. Accusations of treason swirl around the absent governor while the fate of the emperor remains shrouded in mystery. Amid a burgeoning trade crisis with neighboring nations of Tian Xia, the costly hiring of the Typhoon Guard has forced the imposition of crippling taxes, kindling discontent among the populace. Within this chaos, Jiro proposed a daring plan: a visit to the Kuroi Yane market, a covert rendezvous for the nokizarusan—three influential ninjas negotiating the shadowy affairs of multiple ninja clans. Our perilous status as targets of relentless ninja attacks made this meeting crucial. Jiro argued that while the Jade Regent's assassination attempts were driven by gold, perhaps the ninja could be swayed from his service. The Emerald Branch clan, champions of liberty, seemed our likely ally.
			</p>
			<p>
				Utilizing Haldir's magical prowess, we teleported to Enganoka, cloaked in the guise of Minkai commoners. Our quest led us to the bustling market building, where entry required a greased palm. Inside, a chilling scene unfolded as a Daikan Tetsuku officer, the local enforcer, accused a merchant of smuggling and prepared to execute him. Unable to stand by, Edam intervened, blocking the lethal strike. Enraged, the officer attacked, revealing his true monstrous form—an oni—as he fell to Edam's blade. The battle escalated as more disguised oni revealed themselves, attacking with ferocity. Shura's timely spell shielded Edam, turning the tide of the skirmish and forcing the remaining oni to retreat.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the oni dispatched, we proceeded to the restaurant where the Three Monkeys convened. Due to our premature arrival from teleportation, we were ahead of schedule. Nevertheless, Aelfread managed to secure a secretive conversation with one of the ninjas, exchanging gold for a promise of discourse at the next gathering. When the appointed day dawned, we met with no obstacles, yet our hopes were dashed as the Three Monkeys refused any alliance while a death mark loomed over us. Confronted with this new threat, we now face the daunting task of eluding a master ninja determined to claim our heads.

			</figure>
			<p>
				In our relentless quest to restore Ameiko's rightful heritage, Jiro has suggested we align with the geishas of the Kiniro Kyomai tea house, who wield substantial influence over the trade guild and hold secrets of the local nobility. Upon reaching the entertainment district, our battle-ready appearance nearly barred our entry, but Aelfread and Haldir's diplomacy granted us passage. Inside, we sought audience with O-Kohaku, the tea house owner. Initially rebuffed, our mention of a gift—a tactic Jiro had prepared us for—earned us entry. O-Kohaku, though burdened by the mysterious disappearance of her star geisha, O-Sayumi, was moved by our offer to assist. In exchange, she entrusted us with O-Sayumi's trinket, hinting it would aid our search.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our magical attempts to locate O-Sayumi through scrying met only with darkness, leading us to the docks. There, we learned of a merchant's claims that O-Sayumi had never arrived at his island, though the barge that supposedly took her remained unaccounted for. Local sailors' dread of the island fueled our resolve to investigate. The trinket, a finely carved inro with a kappa netsuke, led us to a real kappa, who revealed a chilling tale of O-Sayumi's mother slain by the pearl merchant—an insidious wizard. Guiding us to an abandoned boat, the kappa submerged it, miraculously restoring it for our use.
			</p>
			<p>
				Veiled by early morning fog, we navigated to the island, where we encountered a man with an eerie blue skin tinge. His attempt to flee was thwarted by Haldir's magic. However, an ominous presence enveloped him; not fully alive and emanating malevolence. Despite Haldir's hopes for dialogue, the creature attacked, prompting Edam to intervene with swift strikes of his twin wakizashi, neutralizing the threat. Opting for caution, we circumvented the village and advanced towards a once-grand but now crumbling building. There, an unsettling emptiness awaited us—no signs of life, no clues. Something sinister lurks, and we must tread carefully.

				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="{{ url_for('jade.static', filename='images/shogi.png') }}"><img src="{{ url_for('jade.static', filename='images/shogi.png') }}" alt="shogi game board" class="tall"></a>
				<figcaption>Game Board</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Venturing into the dilapidated mansion, we navigated past double sets of screen walls to a foreboding central room, dominated by a massive stone table featuring an unfinished game of Shogi. Haldir, empowered by his Permanent Detect Magic, sensed an aura of necromancy and illusion wafting from the table. His expertise led him to surmise it was a portal of sorts. Driven by curiosity, he reached out to adjust a game piece, unwittingly triggering the portal. Instantaneously, we were transported onto a colossal Shogi board, each of us confined within glass-like boxes. Aelfread shattered his prison swiftly, inspiring Edam and Tim to follow suit. The commotion stirred the other "pieces" on the board—ghastly shadows whose chilling touch sapped our strength. As Edam’s knees buckled under his armor, weighed down by the spectral cold, Shura and Haldir supported him, enabling Aelfread, Tim, and Edam to defeat the sinister apparitions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further exploration led us down a shadowy hallway to an elderly Tian servant, her eyes wide with fear. Unable to assist in our quest for the missing geisha, she directed us to the sake cellar instead. Descending, we encountered a hallway veiled in impenetrable darkness. Haldir, recognizing another portal, stepped through, the rest of us in tow. We emerged into a bleak expanse where colors faded to mere shadows of gray, and an oppressive darkness threatened to swallow any emitted light. Despite the dreary environment, we managed to locate a moon gate. Its opening was our only path forward.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond the gate lay a room that seemed utterly vacant, yet an ominous sensation prickled at our senses. Edam, cautious but determined, advanced to the room's center. A startling noise halted him, and from the shadows emerged a wraith accompanied by more spectral foes. Edam engaged the wraith directly, while the remainder of us confronted the additional shadows. Haldir’s timely spell rendered the undead corporeal, stripping them of their ghostly advantage and leading to their swift eradication. The battle ended, but the uneasy quiet that followed suggested our trials were far from over.

			</figure>
			<p>
				As we delved deeper into the shadowy corridors, we slowed to allow Edam to scout ahead. However, his encounter with a hexagonal mirror quickly turned from curious to cautionary. Declaring it magic with a wary “nope,” he retreated to consult with our spellcasters. When Haldir approached, bearing a light source, the mirror retaliated with three scorching rays, striking him painfully. The attack ceased as soon as the light was withdrawn, allowing Edam to take a closer look and determine it was a trap. With a characteristic shrug, he disabled the threat by shattering the mirror.
			</p>
			<p>
				Venturing further, Edam entered what appeared to be another empty room. Recalling our previous encounters, he proceeded with caution, only to feel unsettling vibrations beneath his feet. Suddenly, from the darkness emerged three large, armored, worm-like creatures. Although initially they seemed manageable, the situation escalated when one inflicted a severe, shadowy wound on Edam, mimicking the injury soon experienced by Haldir. Rallying together, Shura wielded his hammer with crushing force, Aelfread attacked from the shadows, and Haldir unleashed a barrage of spells, while Edam agilely navigated the battlefield, delivering precise strikes. The creatures fell swiftly to our coordinated assault.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finding the room a dead end, we backtracked, only to discover the previously shattered mirror mysteriously reassembling itself—still cracked, yet unmistakably intact. Unnerved, we hastened from the scene.
			</p>
			<p>
				Returning to a room once filled with undead shadows, we were ambushed by what seemed to be the same spectral assailants. This pattern of recurring battles against familiar foes—whether spectral entities or armored worms—began to fray our nerves and deepen the mystery of this cursed place. Each encounter forced us to look deeper for answers and strategies to safeguard ourselves against these relentless, resurrecting enemies.

				<figcaption>Nue</figcaption>
			</figure>-->
			<p>
			We had stumbled into a labyrinth of moon gates and mystic curtains, each hinting at the arcane puzzle that lay before us. Armed with the mystical Inro gifted by O-Kohaku, we navigated through the maze with a mix of intuition and magic. The Inro's blue and yellow links led us to choose a moon gate crafted from emerald-green jade, suggesting a confluence of energies. Beyond this gate, we encountered a curtain strung with camphor beads, the last of the Inro’s items, and pushed through it, drawn by destiny’s pull.
			</p>
			<p>
			The room beyond held a sinister presence. Our rogue, Edam, crept ahead and spied a bizarre beast prowling within—a Nue, with the body of a tiger, the head of a monkey, and a serpentine tail. Haldir, our sage, recognized the creature's malevolence immediately. As we confronted this chimeric fiend, it hurled a curse at Edam, who charged in retaliation. The beast's form then shifted into a swirling black cloud, sparking with violent 'fireworks,' enveloping Edam and soon after, Shura and Tim. In this chaos, a second Nue materialized and assailed Haldir. Together, we fought fiercely, dispelling the dark mist and vanquishing both manifestations of the Nue.
			</p>
			<p>
			Our investigation of the room revealed two women, statuesque in a perpetual kneel, caught in a spell of gentle repose. Haldir deduced a grim reality—their souls were extracted and held elsewhere. This discovery only deepened the mystery of our quest.
			</p>
			<p>
			Pushing onward, we entered a chamber adorned with a writing desk surrounded by scattered magical artifacts. We gathered what we could and ventured deeper, through another door that led us to what seemed a dead end. Yet, under Haldir’s unyielding gaze of detect magic, an illusion unraveled, revealing a portal veiled in shadows. Stepping through, we were cast into a world drained of color, where every shade turned to gray.
			</p>
			<p>
			In this monochrome realm, an elderly Tien man awaited us, calmly sipping tea. He warned that our actions bore unintended consequences. Yet, as Edam sensed a surge of malevolence from him, the man unveiled a tragic tale. He confessed to a failed ritual meant to transfer his second wife’s soul into O-Sayumi, his daughter from a previous marriage. The ritual’s failure had lost his wife’s soul to the shadow realm while trapping O-Sayumi’s essence through dark enchantments. His story laid bare a twisted path of love, power, and loss, urging us to reconsider our quest, lest we disturb the fragile balance further.

			<h4>October 28</h4>
			<figure class="logLeftPic">
				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="{{ url_for('jade.static', filename='images/Yugureda_Shosaito.png') }}"><img src="{{ url_for('jade.static', filename='images/Yugureda_Shosaito.png') }}" alt="Yugureda Shosaito"></a>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The confrontation with the old Tien man, Yugurdea Shosaito, reached a fever pitch when he scornfully dismissed our pleas to halt his dark ritual. With a sinister sneer, he scattered thousands of pearls across the floor, challenging us to find the soul of O-Sayumi among them. At a snap of his fingers, shadows coalesced into a tangible menace. Our battle-hardened group sprang into action; Edam swiftly dispatched the summoned shadow, while Yugurdea cursed Haldir with a debilitating spell that sapped his strength. As the room's light dimmed ominously, more shadows emerged, seemingly drawn from our own fears.
				</p>
				<p>
				In a desperate attempt to regain control, Yugurdea vanished only to reappear with a chilling touch against Haldir, attempting to ensnare his mind and soul. Despite the grave danger, Haldir resisted the dark enchantment. Meanwhile, Tim crushed the advancing shadows with relentless fury, even as Yugurdea conjured a fearsome derghaodaemon into the fray. Our teamwork was tested like never before.
				</p>
				<p>
				While Edam and Tim battled the lingering shadows, Haldir wove through the chaos, casting spells that turned the tide of battle. It was Shura who delivered a decisive move, banishing the daemon back to its native plane with a powerful incantation. Finally, with most of the immediate threats dispatched, Edam and Tim cornered Yugurdea. In a climactic duel, Tim struck the fatal blow with his greatsword, ending the old man's reign of terror.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the aftermath, amidst the scattered pearls, we discovered the one containing O-Sayumi’s soul within Yugurdea's Inro. The room, now silent, offered no exits—a trap designed to be Yugurdea’s final gambit. Haldir's mastery of magic proved essential once again as he cast greater teleport to whisk us away to safety, returning to the wise old kappa who had guided us before. With the pearls and our newfound knowledge, we restored O-Sayumi and Taukimi to their bodies. Taukimi resolved to mend the rifts her husband had caused, while O-Sayumi’s joyous reunion at the teahouse marked a poignant end to our journey. This act of restoration garnered us new allies, arranging critical meetings that promised to advance our quest to restore Ameiko to her rightful throne.

				<figcaption>Atamahuta</figcaption>

			<p>
				Our quest led us to a clandestine meeting with the brother of a formidable Daimyo, a tyrant whose allegiance to the Regent was a significant barrier to our goals. Though he commanded an army of a hundred soldiers to enforce his ruthless will, his brother, seeking a change in leadership, divulged crucial intelligence to us. He described a hunting lodge where the Daimyo often retreated, leaving his army behind at a workers' camp. This, he revealed, would be our opportunity to strike. He also informed us of seven ronin who had secretly infiltrated the camp with a similar aim and assured us of their support should we align our efforts. The brother promised that with his sibling out of the way, he would ascend to leadership and aid our cause.
				</p>
				<p>
				Under the veil of Haldir's powerful disguising spells, we merged with the Tien commoners at the workers' camp. There, the seven ronin, distinguishable by their wary, battle-ready demeanor, quickly became our allies. They agreed to hold the army at bay, ensuring that no reinforcements could disrupt our mission at the lodge. With their assurance, we advanced towards our target, hearts set on confrontation.
				</p>
				<p>
				Our infiltration of the hunting lodge went smoothly as we subdued the initial guards without raising an alarm. Delving deeper, we encountered a door muffling the distinct sounds of vigilant guards—likely the last line of defense before reaching the Daimyo. Haldir swiftly enveloped the area in a blanket of silence with a well-cast spell, though one alert guard managed to hurl a thunderstone beyond the spell's reach, sending a booming alert through the lodge's walls. Anticipating the Daimyo's escape, Edam rushed ahead and stumbled upon him just beyond the fragile barrier of a paper wall. Engaging both the Daimyo and his formidable bodyguard single-handedly, Edam realized the peril of his audacity through swift and harsh blows. It was Tim, bursting heroically through the paper partition, who turned the tide, aiding Edam in a fierce struggle that saw the fall of both the tyrant and his protector.

				<figcaption>Sikutsu Sennaka</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				After the defeat of the Daimyo and his bodyguard, we moved swiftly to scour the hunting lodge. As Edam prowled the hallways, a soft sobbing echoed from a dimly lit room. Unable to discern the source in the gloom, he regrouped with us to share his findings. Curiosity piqued, Aelfread and Haldir ventured to investigate. They found a young woman in tears, but the air tingled with unease. Their caution proved wise as the facade crumbled; the 'distressed damsel' revealed her true form, stepping out from her cage. To our astonishment, what we had mistaken for innocuous balls on the shelves transformed into winged, fanged horrors swirling around us. But Haldir, quick on the draw, unleashed an electrified fireball that rendered the room eerily silent once more, the threat extinguished in a blaze of arcane fury. A quick sweep confirmed there was nothing more to find, prompting our swift departure.
				</p>
				<p>
				Teleporting back to the workers' camp, a ronin hurriedly updated us. Their efforts had stalled the army's advance towards the lodge, but it was clear we couldn't linger. With a mutual nod of respect, we parted ways and teleported to our next destination—Jiro's fortress. Greeted by Jiro's congratulations, we were advised to rest and recuperate. That night passed in peaceful slumber, but the following day was shattered by a maniacal laugh and an ominous shadow that briefly eclipsed the sun. As we pondered this foreboding sign, a deafening explosion rocked the fortress, cutting off the alarm.
				</p>
				<p>
				Rushing outside, we were met with a scene of chaos: a monstrous two-headed atamahuta, a towering fire yai, and a cadre of samurai and mage oni had laid siege to the fortress. With no time to waste, we rallied, casting protective enchantments in preparation for the fierce battle ahead. The oni unleashed their own barrage of magic—tentacles writhing from the earth and waves of searing flame. Amidst this maelstrom, Aelfread and Tim charged forward, while Edam utilized a dimension door spell, transporting himself, Haldir, and Haldir's faithful dog into a flanking position. Shura, wielding his hammer with deadly precision, alternated between crushing blows and vital healing spells to sustain Tim. Together, we turned the tide, driving back the onslaught and securing a hard-fought victory over the invaders.

			<h4>Paizo's End of Book 4</h4>
			<p>
			<h4 id="newest">November 11</h4>
			<p>
				Concluding the Adventure: With the fall of Nigankona and the oni, our heroes have clinched a crucial victory against formidable foes of the Jade Regent. This triumph has galvanized Jiro and Hatsue, affirming their resolve that the Jade Regent must be ousted to restore the rightful heir, Ameiko, to the Jade Throne. The death of Sikutsu Sennaka, and the ascendancy of his brother Itsuru as governor, has swayed the provinces of Enganoka and Sakakabe to join the northeastern provinces in defiance against the Jade Regent. Momentum is now on the side of the rebels.
				</p>
				<p>
				Amidst a burgeoning spirit of rebellion, the samurai begin to envision assembling an army to march south and seize the capital from the despot’s grip. Although the Jade Regent’s forces remain formidable, the newfound support from Minkai’s merchants and ninja bolsters the rebels' chances. Under the leadership of Sikutsu Itsuru and Hirabashi Jiro, the rebel army commences its march from Seinaru Heikaku. While the army confronts the Regent's forces outside Kasai, a different destiny awaits Ameiko and the player characters.
				</p>
				<p>
				According to Itsuru, a new emperor must secure the approval of past emperors of Minkai before ascending the Jade Throne. Thus, our protagonists, alongside Ameiko, must venture to the Imperial Shrine located on an enigmatic island near Kasai. It is here that they hope to earn the ancient emperors’ sanction. With this divine endorsement, they will be poised to challenge the Jade Regent directly at the Imperial Palace. The epic conclusion of our quest looms on the horizon in the final chapter of the Jade Regent Adventure Path, “The Empty Throne.”
